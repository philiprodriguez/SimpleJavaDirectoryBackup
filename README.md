# Simple Java Directory Backup
This is supposed to be a one-night project. The goal is simple: make a tool for routinely copying some target directory from one place to another place. The purpose is simply to prevent a case where a storage device dies and you lose all your data in some important root directory.

# Functionality
 - Make routine backups of a folder
 - Set the amount of space allowed to be used or the number of copies to be kept
 - Set how often to copy the folder
